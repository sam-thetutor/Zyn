## Balance Requirements

### Minimum Balance Needed
- **Current**: 0.00011 ETH ✅ (You have this!)
- **Production**: 0.02+ ETH (When you're ready to scale up)

### What You Can Do Now
✅ Create 1 market  
✅ Buy Yes shares (0.00003 ETH)  
✅ Buy No shares (0.00003 ETH)  
✅ Have gas buffer for transactions  

## Next Steps

1. **Test the current setup** with your 0.00011 ETH balance
2. **Deploy the updated contract** to Base mainnet
3. **Run the market creation script** to test functionality
4. **When ready for production**, use the fee management script to increase fees

## Important Notes

- **Low fees are for testing only** - not sustainable for production
- **Gas costs** are still significant relative to transaction values
- **Fee updates** require contract owner privileges
- **All changes are reversible** using the fee management functions
